[üì∫ Azure DevOps - Github connection](https://dev.to/pwd9000/integrating-azure-devops-with-github-hybrid-model-3pkg)

- **Repository Management**:
  - Repos are structured per project/component as needed
- **Branch Strategy**:
  - Two main branches: `development` (default for development), `main` (production-ready)
  - Feature and Bug branches: `feature/<ticket-id>-short-description` or `bug/<ticket-id>-short-description` ‚Äî this is just a naming convention. The word `feature/` is not a folder; it's part of the branch name to organize and identify branches logically (e.g., `feature/123-login-form`).
- **Code Review Rules**:
  - PRs will be reviewed by another team member before merging
  - User stories of reviewed PRs will be merged and closed by the reviewer
- **Commit Linking Requirement**:
  - Every commit must be linked to an Azure DevOps user story or bug by including the work item ID in the commit message using the AB#{id} syntax. [Click here for more infomation about linking](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/link-to-from-github?view=azure-devops#use-ab-to-link-from-github-to-azure-boards-work-items)
  - Example: AB#28 this commit is a test

| Task             | Subtasks linked to user stories for detailed implementation                                | About 1 hour              | Add the fine tuned model in the DB scheme excel file  |

- **Project Management**:
  - Everyone is responsible for keeping the board up-to-date. It is not the responsibility of the team lead to clean it up.
  - Use the [**Board**](XXX) view to track sprint-specific tasks
  - Use the [**Backlog**](XXX) view to manage overall structure (Epics > Features > User Stories/Bugs)
- **Board Columns**:
  - **New**: Newly added work items
  - **Active**: Currently in progress
  - **Blocked / Waiting for**: Progress is stalled due to dependencies on others
  - **Review**: Work completed and ready for review by Maris or Lucas
  - **Closed**: Reviewed and accepted
- **Work Item Types**:
  - **User Stories**: For new features or improvements
  - **Bugs**: For defects that need fixing

### 5. Communication & Meetings

- **Sprint Length**: TBD
- **weekly checkups**: 13:30 on Tuesdays

### 6. Good Practices

- Use **Python version 3.11.7** for all development
